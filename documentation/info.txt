UPLOAD_FOLDER: Directory where uploaded files will be stored.
MERGED_FOLDER: Directory where the merged PDF will be stored.
The directories are created if they do not exist.

/upload: Handles the file upload and merging process.
Upload and Merge:

The upload_files function handles the file upload. It saves the uploaded files to the UPLOAD_FOLDER.
It then calls the merge_pdfs function to merge the uploaded PDFs and saves the merged PDF in the MERGED_FOLDER.
Finally, it returns the merged PDF for download.
HTML Form:

The form allows users to upload multiple PDF files.
