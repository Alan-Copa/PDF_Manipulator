Explanation:
Flask Configuration:

UPLOAD_FOLDER: Directory where uploaded files will be stored.
MERGED_FOLDER: Directory where the merged PDF will be stored.
The directories are created if they do not exist.
Routes:

/: Serves the HTML form for file uploads.
/upload: Handles the file upload and merging process.

Upload and Merge:

The upload_files function handles the file upload. It saves the uploaded files to the UPLOAD_FOLDER.
It then calls the merge_pdfs function to merge the uploaded PDFs and saves the merged PDF in the MERGED_FOLDER.
Finally, it returns the merged PDF for download.
HTML Form:

The form allows users to upload multiple PDF files.

=== ENHANCED MERGE FEATURE (Feb 2026) ===

User Control & Flexibility:
- Upload multiple PDFs at once or add one at a time
- Drag & drop files onto upload area
- Add more files anytime during the process

Order Management:
- Drag and drop files to reorder (maintains merge sequence)
- Visual numbering (1, 2, 3...) shows exact merge order
- Drag handle (☰) on each file for easy reordering

File Management:
- Remove individual files with × button
- "Clear All" button to reset
- Displays file name and size for each PDF
- Minimum 2 files required to merge

UI/UX Improvements:
- Modern drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time progress bar
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Scrollable file list with custom styling
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Auto-cleanup and reset after successful merge

Technical Implementation:
- JavaScript handles drag-and-drop reordering client-side
- Files sent to backend in user-specified order
- Backend merges PDFs sequentially per file order
- Automatic cleanup of temporary uploaded files

=== IMAGE TO PDF CONVERSION FEATURE (Feb 2026) ===

Overview:
- Convert image files to PDF format
- Supports multiple image formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF
- Single or batch conversion capability
- High-quality conversion preserving image dimensions

Supported Formats:
✓ JPG/JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group
✓ PNG - Portable Network Graphics  
✓ BMP - Bitmap Image File
✓ GIF - Graphics Interchange Format

User Interface:
- Drag & drop or click to select images
- Visual upload area with format hints
- File preview showing selected image count and names
- Convert button appears only after file selection
- Real-time progress indicator during conversion
- Animated icons and smooth transitions

Conversion Process:
1. User selects one or more image files
2. System validates file types (images only)
3. Images uploaded to server
4. Each image converted to individual PDF using img2pdf library
5. Converted PDFs saved to database/converted/ folder
6. Automatic download of converted file(s)
7. Temporary uploaded images cleaned up automatically

Technical Implementation:
Backend (Python/Flask):
- img2pdf library for image-to-PDF conversion
- File validation by extension checking
- Secure filename handling with werkzeug
- Separate storage for converted files (database/converted/)
- Error handling for unsupported formats
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript):
- Custom styled upload area with gradient backgrounds
- Accept attribute limits file picker to image types
- JavaScript shows file selection feedback
- Progress bar with percentage display
- Form submission via AJAX with upload tracking
- Auto-redirect to download on completion

Key Features:
✓ Multiple file conversion in one operation
✓ Preserves original image quality and dimensions
✓ No image compression during conversion
✓ Fast conversion using optimized img2pdf library
✓ Responsive design matching app theme
✓ Visual feedback throughout process
✓ Error messages for invalid file types
✓ Automatic file cleanup to save disk space

Security & Validation:
- File extension validation (whitelist approach)
- Secure filename sanitization
- Server-side format verification
- Prevents non-image file uploads
- Protected upload/download endpoints

Storage Structure:
database/
  ├── uploads/       (temporary image storage)
  ├── merged/        (merged PDF outputs)
  └── converted/     (converted PDF outputs)

Dependencies:
- img2pdf: Core conversion library
- Pillow: Image processing (img2pdf dependency)
- Flask: Web framework
- werkzeug: Secure filename handling

Future Enhancements (Potential):
- Merge multiple images into single PDF
- Image compression options
- Page orientation selection (portrait/landscape)
- Image rotation before conversion
- Batch download as ZIP file
- Preview images before conversion
- OCR text extraction option
