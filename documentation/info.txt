Explanation:
Flask Configuration:

UPLOAD_FOLDER: Directory where uploaded files will be stored.
MERGED_FOLDER: Directory where the merged PDF will be stored.
The directories are created if they do not exist.
Routes:

/: Serves the HTML form for file uploads.
/upload: Handles the file upload and merging process.

Upload and Merge:

The upload_files function handles the file upload. It saves the uploaded files to the UPLOAD_FOLDER.
It then calls the merge_pdfs function to merge the uploaded PDFs and saves the merged PDF in the MERGED_FOLDER.
Finally, it returns the merged PDF for download.
HTML Form:

The form allows users to upload multiple PDF files.

=== ENHANCED MERGE FEATURE (Feb 2026) ===

User Control & Flexibility:
- Upload multiple PDFs at once or add one at a time
- Drag & drop files onto upload area
- Add more files anytime during the process

Order Management:
- Drag and drop files to reorder (maintains merge sequence)
- Visual numbering (1, 2, 3...) shows exact merge order
- Drag handle (☰) on each file for easy reordering

File Management:
- Remove individual files with × button
- "Clear All" button to reset
- Displays file name and size for each PDF
- Minimum 2 files required to merge

UI/UX Improvements:
- Modern drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time progress bar
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Scrollable file list with custom styling
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Auto-cleanup and reset after successful merge

Technical Implementation:
- JavaScript handles drag-and-drop reordering client-side
- Files sent to backend in user-specified order
- Backend merges PDFs sequentially per file order
- Automatic cleanup of temporary uploaded files
